                       <h2>Håkon Wium Lie - Creator of CSS</h2>
                       <br>
                       <p>Håkon is a Norwegian web pioneer and is best known for developing CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, which we now know tells how web pages are presented, including typography, aesthetics, and accessibility. </p>
                       <br>
                       <p>Working alongside Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web itself, Lie is the man who gave it its familiar look by inventing CSS in late 1990s (Lie & Bos, 2005). Having worked on the CSS specifications, including CSS1, CSS2,and RFC 2318, he helped CSS establish itself as one of the fundamental web standards. From 1999 until 2016, he was the CTO of Opera Software, working on standards support in browsers, which put CSS into practice. He has been an activist for standards in general and has been involved in campaigns to make web browsers easier for downloading fonts, prints and publishing videos (Alvestrand & Lie, 2009). </p>
                       <br>
                       <p>In terms of his importance for Computer Science, he built a bridge between designers and programmers by providing people an opportunity to decide font size, colours, typography, layout, margins and shadows and such. It’s argued that if CSS hadn’t been created, the web would have ended up being a giant fax machine. It’s no secret that HTML would have been very different if CSS had not appeared, some computing experts went as far as to say that his work was what saved HTML (Lindberg, 2016). This text-based, semantic-based language underneath has provided essential support to HTML. </p>
                       <br>
                       <p>The creation is also sustainable and adaptable. At the time, CSS wasn’t the only proposed stylesheet language, but it had one feature that distinguished it from all the competitors - it took into account of both the readers and the authors wishes, in other words, the capabilities of the display device and the browser (Alvestrand & Lie, 2009). Due to his foresight, for example, CSS works on a lot of devices that weren’t present when it was first created, including mobile phones. He’s always been on a mission to improve the web until today, where he sees commercial technologies, such as the rise of iPhone apps as new threats (Lindberg, 2016). </p>

                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Facts:</strong> In less than three weeks, this module provided a foundation to computer science, including Computational Thinking, Number Systems and Data Representation, introduction to programming and the basics of writing HTML and CSS code.  </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>Feelings:</strong> My first reaction was a loss of direction. I felt that I was jumping in between different areas of brand new concepts that I was struggling to understand, let alone being able to utilise. </li>
                                <br>
                                <li> <p><strong>Findings:</strong> In reflection, these seemingly separate topics turn out to be greatly connected and interlinked. For example, when I was first introduced different number systems, I knew that it’s probably important to understand how computers process numbers but couldn’t specify why. Until I started to learn different concepts in programming, one of which was the Boolean expressions. I learned that Boolean variables are represented as binary numbers so 1 = true and 0 = false. I believe that it’s helpful to be able to draw a connection between the binary number system that the computers use and the language structure and logic that will guide me through programming.
                                </p>
                                <br>  
                                    <p>Another example would be the application of Computational Thinking in a broader context than I’d anticipated. When I first received the assessment brief, I wanted to get started on HTML straightaway, which proved to be counter-productive. I realised it was good to decompose the entire task into smaller parts and to work out a step-by-step plan of action, two of key techniques of Computational Thinking. Shortly after I discovered that it was much more helpful to design the webpages by using a pen and a piece of paper first and foremost. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li> <p><strong>Future:</strong> One of my plans for future study would be to be more mindful of possible connections during this module. This can be bridging a gap between the familiar and the unfamiliar, for example between what I know about HTML and news concepts of Java, or it can also be useful among different aspects I will be learning in the future. 
                                </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Another lesson to take is to try to use Computational Thinking as a natural approach to solving problems, which will come in handy during the rest of this semester. 
                                    Also, in general, this quick but thorough introduction in the past few weeks seem valuable in understanding how a computer does what it does, for example, variables don’t have concept of history but only the current value, which I need to take into consideration when giving computers instructions. This helps me bridge the gap between our everyday human language and the programming language I will use in future studies, including their similarities and differences.
